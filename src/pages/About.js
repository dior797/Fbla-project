    <p className='mission'>Land-Locked is a locally owned and operated business that works hard to help the community and environment. We started this business keeping in mind that people always have clothes and other cool items that they want to get rid of. With this in mind we clean all the clothes that we get in and try to restore them so that they can have a new owner. The clothes that do not sell or they are very hard to restore we give away to shelters.
